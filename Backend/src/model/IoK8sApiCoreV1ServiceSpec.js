Several other fields do not apply to ExternalName services. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types  Possible enum values:  - `\"ClusterIP\"` means a service will only be accessible inside the cluster, via the cluster IP.  - `\"ExternalName\"` means a service consists of only a reference to an external name that kubedns or equivalent will return as a CNAME record, with no exposing or proxying of any pods involved.  - `\"LoadBalancer\"` means a service will be exposed via an external load balancer (if the cloud provider supports it), in addition to 'NodePort' type.  - `\"NodePort\"` means a service will be exposed on one port of every node, in addition to 'ClusterIP' type.
